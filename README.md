# Sandwich Club Mobile App Project 

## Project Overview
In this project, you will complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of a sandwich once it is selected.

## App Purpose

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## Responsbilities

Designed the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implemented the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.

- Practice JSON parsing to a model object (DONE)
